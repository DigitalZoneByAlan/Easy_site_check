✅ Prerequisites for Running the Python Script Before using the Python script, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) from the official website:

👉 https://www.python.org/downloads/

🛠️ During installation (Windows only): Make sure to check the box that says “Add Python to PATH” during installation. This ensures you can run Python from the command line.

🔍 Check if Python is installed and which version you're using: Open Command Prompt, PowerShell, Terminal (Linux/macOS), and enter:

command 
>python --version 
or 
>python3 --version

Output (example): Python 3.10.11

Any version of Python 3.6 or later is compatible with this script.

📦 Install the requests library After verifying Python is installed, you need to install the requests library, which the script depends on.

✅ On Windows (CMD or PowerShell):

command 
>pip install requests
or
>pip3 install requests

✅ On Linux/macOS (Terminal):

command 
>python3 -m pip install requests
or
>pip3 install requests

💡 Tip: On some Linux systems, you may need to install pip first using your package manager (e.g., sudo apt install python3-pip for Debian/Ubuntu).
